# Unity specific ignore
# Don't ignore Packages folder to track the package manager manifest (if you have Packages folder in your repository).
# However, consider ignoring it in case of an embedded package (e.g. if you have your own Unity package in development).
# To add Packages/manifest.json to the ignore list, uncomment the following line:
# /Packages/manifest.json

# Asset meta data should only be ignored when the corresponding asset is also ignored
!/[Aa]ssets/**/*.meta

# Uncomment this line if you wish to ignore the asset store tools plugin

# Uncomment if on macOS:

# Uncomment if on Linux:
